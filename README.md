📚 **ANN and CNN Interview Questions**

🔹 **Question 1:**
🤔 What is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?

📝 **Answer:**
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons or units, organized into layers. ANNs are used for various tasks such as pattern recognition, regression, and classification.

🔹 **Question 2:**
🤔 What are the main components of an ANN?

📝 **Answer:**
The main components of an ANN are:
- **Input Layer:** Receives the input data.
- **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers that perform computations.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final output or prediction.
- **Weights and Biases:** Parameters that are learned during training.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity to the network.

🔹 **Question 3:**
🤔 What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

📝 **Answer:**
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of neural network designed for processing and analyzing structured grid-like data, such as images. CNNs leverage convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual features, enabling them to excel in image classification and object detection tasks.

🔹 **Question 4:**
🤔 What is the purpose of convolutional layers in CNNs?

📝 **Answer:**
Convolutional layers in CNNs are responsible for applying filters or kernels to input images, enabling the network to extract local patterns and features. By performing convolutions across the input, CNNs can capture spatial relationships, detect edges, textures, and other important visual characteristics.

🔹 **Question 5:**
🤔 What are pooling layers in CNNs and why are they used?

📝 **Answer:**
Pooling layers in CNNs reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps, reducing the computational complexity and controlling overfitting. Max pooling and average pooling are commonly used pooling techniques that retain the most salient features by selecting the maximum or average values within a defined window.

🔹 **Question 6:**
🤔 What is the concept of weight sharing in CNNs?

📝 **Answer:**
Weight sharing is a fundamental concept in CNNs where the same set of weights (or filters) is applied across different spatial locations of an input. This property allows CNNs to efficiently learn and detect similar features in different parts of the input, resulting in translation-invariant representations.

🔹 **Question 7:**
🤔 What are some applications of ANN and CNN?

📝 **Answer:**
ANNs and CNNs have a wide range of applications, including:
- ANN: Speech recognition, sentiment analysis, fraud detection.
- CNN: Image classification, object detection, image segmentation.
